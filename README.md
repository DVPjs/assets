## ✦ Assets

This `Git` repository is meant for:

- **Holding assets that are connected via API**  
  Store shared assets such as icons, logos, default configs, and other static files that can be fetched dynamically by all panels.

- **Holding files like JSON formats to broadcast things out to ALL panels**  
  Example: global status updates, maintenance notices, or universal settings. Panels can pull these JSON files to display global messages or sync important data in real-time.

---

### ✦ Why use this?

Using a dedicated asset repo allows you to:

- ✧ Update global assets without redeploying each panel instance.
- ✧ Ensure consistent design and configuration across all user environments.
- ✧ Distribute critical messages or statuses to all users at once.
- ✧ Maintain a secure and centralized source of truth for your panel data.

---

### ✦ Example Use Cases

- A global `status.json` file to show service health:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "message": "All systems operational"
  }
  ```
- Shared configuration files like theme settings or allowed IP lists.
- Banners or announcements that appear instantly across all active panels.
